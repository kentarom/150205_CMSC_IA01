# Visualizing Sensors using Arduino and Processing

This project includes two files - the Arduino code, and the Processing code.

visualizerâ€™s concept is ripples on the water. And It should be comfortable.


A0 and A1 are for analog senser like a variable resistance or a photodetector. D0 is for digital data like a push swich.
